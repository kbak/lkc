<h1>Improving Usability of the Linux Kernel Configuration Tools</h1>

<p>By Karim Ali & Kacper Bak</p>
<p>July 29th, 2010</p>

<h2>Linux kernel configuration has always been a challenge for non-experts. Why?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>Linux is composed of almost six thousand configuration options, i.e. overwhelming variation space.</li>
		<li>Current configuration tools are aimed at experts and experienced users.</li>
		<li>Current infrastructure has significant deficiencies with regard to variability language, engine, and end-user usability.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Is this a significant problem?</h2>
<p>People configure operating system kernels for several reasons. Usually, they want to customize kernels to specific hardware or to particular needs. The majority of users configure kernels without even realizing this fact. We distinguish between two types of kernel configuration: static and dynamic. In the
former method, software is customized before compilation so that only chosen pieces of code are compiled. It results in a smaller program footprint and faster compilation. On the other hand, the latter configuration requires more effort because any additional piece of software has to be compiled separately. In many modern distributions users are provided with fully functional kernels, which they do not have to compile themselves. Instead, they dynamically customize the software by loading relevant modules. The disadvantage of the second method is that preparing such a big kernel takes a lot of time and resources.</p>

<p>Regardless of the configuration type, there is still need to customize the software. Although this task can be done manually, most users prefer to use automated and intuitive tools that could guarantee that the system works properly. Unfortunately, the software currently used for kernel configuration is neither fully automated nor easy to use. In addition, static and dynamic configuration are two separate mechanisms and are supported by completely different programs. Static configuration is done by the Linux Kernel Configurator, while dynamic configuration is done by adding or removing compiled modules using other tools (e.g. <b>modprobe</b>). In our opinion, the two worlds can be merged to provide a single user interface.</p>

<h2>How did we tackle the problem?</h2>

<p align="center">Figure 1. Different project stages</p>
<p>The project went through <a href="#flow">three major stages</a>. First, we carried out an initial user study to identify major usability issues of the current Linux kernel configuration tools. We then proposed some alternative mockup designs based on the feedback we got from the participants. Second, we carried out a user study to get comments and constructive feedback on the various design mockups we had for our tool prototype. According to the feedback, we reflected user suggestions and remarks in the implementation of the prototype. Finally, we did a final user study to evaluate our prototype and compare it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xconfig">xconfig</a>. General reactions of the test group were positive and participants saw the new tool as an improvement over the standard tools. We believe that our findings will help in creating better configuration applications not only for the Linux kernel, but also for other kinds of variability models.</p>

<h3>Initial User Study</h3>
<p>We carried out an initial user study where six participants were asked to statically configure the Linux kernel for a popular laptop for typical home or office use. They used the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xconfig">xconfig</a> tool that comes with the Linux kernel. We observed many usability problems that people faced during the configuration process. Our findings can summarized as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>menu hierarchy</b> should be as simple as possible. There are far too many options that could be reduced automatically if the configuration tool targeted a specific user group (novice and intermediate users) and had good reasoning capabilities.</li>
		<li><b>Feature names and descriptions</b> should reflect end-user functionality instead of low-level details.</li>
		<li>Powerful <b>searching</b> capabilities are crucial as the number of configuration options grows.</li>
		<li><b>Automatic hardware detection</b> and kernel autoconfiguration is important since the majority of kernel options are related to hardware drivers.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Design Mockups Evaluation</h3>
<p> We designed several mockups that reflect the feedback we got from the participants of our initial user study. We had two categories of designs, one for the splash screen shown to the user once the application is launched. The other category of designs is for the application prototype itself. <a href="#splash">Figure 2</a> shows the design mockups for the former, while <a href="#lkc">Figure 3</a> shows those for the latter.</p>

<p>We then showed the participants of our second user study with those design. Accordingly to the feedback we got, we could make the following conclusions:
	<ul>
		<li>Users always like to know <b>what is going on</b>. In other words, they did care about getting more information about what the tool is doing while the progress bars are being filled up.</li>
		<li>Users appreciate <b>access to more information</b>, but prefer such information to be displayed only <b>when requested</b> rather than by default.</li>
		<li>It is highly desirable to have the tool <b>report any crashes</b> that occur during the hardware detection process.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The feedback we got from the users about the design mockups of the tool prototype allowed us to deduce the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Almost all users liked having <b>helpful descriptions</b> for the various kernel features they can select.</li>
		<li><b>Easy navigation</b> through the various categories of features was also on top of their desirable design features.</li>
		<li>The <b>fewer</b> the number of <b>categories</b> were, the <b>easier</b> it was for the users <b>to find</b> features.</li>
		<li>Some users did not like the wizard-based design (Figure 3d) because it did not offer easy navigation through features and did not provide a search feature.</li>
		<li>Most users liked the fact that they were presented by a <b>summary</b> of the configuration file at the end of the process with the ability to review it and maybe modify it before quitting the application.</li>
		<li>Although many users were not in favor of the wizard-based design, they did like the <b>question format</b> that was presented in that design. The reason is that it gave them a better understanding of the effect of selecting/deselecting features.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>So, can we do better?</h2>
<p>Definitely. We can always come up with better user interface designs if we identify the usability problems with the current kernel configuration tools and try to solve them. That's exactly what we did in the previous user studies and we came up with a suggested prototype for such tool. 
</p>

<a name="prototype">

		<td align="center"><img src="lkc-final2.png" width="413" height="313" alt="suggested lkc prototype design - purpose"></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center">(c)</td>
		<td align="center">(d)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p align="center">Figure 4. Suggested <b>lkc</b> prototype design</p>

<h2>Is this design really better?</h2>
<p>We carried out another user study to answer that question. The aim of that study was to compare the usability of <b>xconfig</b> and our <b>lkc</b> prototype. The feedback we got was a mixture of appreciating the suggested tool prototype and some suggestions to improve the design. The positive feedback we got from users was that our prototype is definitely an <b>improvement</b> compared to <b>xconfig</b>. Users had various reasons to make such
a statement. In general, comments stated that the prototype is <b>simple</b>, <b>intuitive</b> and easy to use. Additionally, users really appreciated the <b>two-way navigation</b>: free navigation through the left panel, and wizard-based navigation through <i>Back/Next</i> buttons. Users also appreciated the <b>statistics</b> panel because it gave them an idea of how their current selections reflect on the overall status of the kernel that will be configured using the generated configuration file. Finally, <b>hiding unnecessary details</b> and not overwhelming users with an explosion of features was another source of appreciation.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, some users experienced <b>difficulties</b> using our prototype. One user did not know the <b>meaning of features in the statistics panel</b>. Two users did not quite understand <b>what stability means</b> in our prototype. The option <b>Minimal configuration</b> was rather confusing for one of our users. Finally, one of the users commented on the fact that the study we carried on was <b>biased</b> because it was easy to accomplish the task just by answering the questions provided by the tool.
</p>

<h2>We're good to go then?</h2>
<p>Actually, we only took the first steps and we have many steps ahead of us to be able to claim that the problem is solved (partially at least). However, we think we are on the right track. Additionaly, we got a very rich feedback from the participants of our final user study about the design of our prototype. Implementing some of those suggestions would add more value to the prototype. The design suggestions include the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Provide progressive disclosure to accommodate both advanced and less experienced users.</li>
		<li>Have the ability to re-detect hardware.</li>
		<li>Provide info about detected hardware.</li>
		<li>Change the position of the <i>Save</i> button.</li>
		<li>Always enable <i>Finish</i> button. When clicked, it should show a dialog with three options: <i>Save & Quit</i>, <i>Save</i>, and
<i>Cancel</i>.
		<li>Move <i>Previous/Next</i> tool bar buttons closer to the left panel because they are ways of controlling the navigation through it.</li>
		<li>Keep track of history.</li>
		<li>Resolve conflicts.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel is a complex piece of software that is highly customizable which might overwhelm novice and intermediate users. Currently available tools do not provide an adequate solution for them. The results of our user studies show that users (even advanced users) prefer to have some features available in a typical Linux kernel configuration tool. Such <b>features</b> include: <b>free navigation</b>, <b>few categories of features</b>, <b>understandable (and helpful) description text</b>, <b>useful search tools</b>, <b>automatic hardware detection</b>. Finally, it would be interesting to have a fully functional application with all the desired features implemented and use it for real life scenarios and get feedback from the FOSS community about the feature set it provides, and its design.

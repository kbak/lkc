    final static String description = "Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets " +
    		"that pass through your Linux box. " +
    		"The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as " +
    		"a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of " +
    		"firewall provided by this kernel support is called a \"packet " +
    		"filter\", which means that it can reject individual network packets " +
    		"based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall, " +
    		"a \"proxy-based\" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more " +
    		"bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more " +
    		"closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level " +
    		"protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based " +
    		"firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local " +
    		"clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but " +
    		"they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if " +
    		"you say \"Yes\" here.\n\n" +
    		"You should also say \"Yes\" here if you intend to use your Linux box as " +
    		"the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without " +
    		"globally valid IP addresses. This is called \"masquerading\": if one " +
    		"of the computers on your local network wants to send something to " +
    		"the outside, your box can \"masquerade\" as that computer, i.e. it " +
    		"forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but " +
    		"modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the " +
    		"firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host " +
    		"replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the " +
    		"correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net " +
    		"are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can " +
    		"reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to " +
    		"run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network " +
    		"using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often " +
    		"called NAT (Network Address Translation).\n\n" +
    		"Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on " +
    		"the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux " +
    		"box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server, " +
    		"typically a caching proxy server.\n\n" +
    		"Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using " +
    		"a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables \"see\" " +
    		"the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet " +
    		"protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter " +
    		"configuration).\n\n" +
    		"Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous " +
    		"masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent " +
    		"proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see " +
    		"<file:Documentation/Changes> under \"iptables\" for the location of " +
    		"these packages.";
    
    final static String descriptionQos = "When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network " +
    		"device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to " +
    		"delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the queueing " +
    		"disciplines, several different algorithms for how to do this " +
    		"\"fairly\" have been proposed.\n\n" +
    		"If you say \"No\" here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which " +
    		"is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say \"Yes\" here, you will be " +
    		"able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can " +
    		"then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for " +
    		"example if some of your network devices are real time devices that " +
    		"need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the " +
    		"maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria. " +
    		"This code is considered to be experimental.\n\n" +
    		"To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities " +
    		"from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>. " +
    		"That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out " +
    		"<http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Iproute2>.\n\n" +
    		"This Quality of Service (QoS) support will enable you to use " +
    		"Differentiated Services (diffserv) and Resource Reservation Protocol " +
    		"(RSVP) on your Linux router if you also say Y to the corresponding " +
    		"classifiers below. Documentation and software is at " +
    		"<http://diffserv.sourceforge.net/>.\n\n" +
